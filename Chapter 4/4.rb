# 4. What will each block of code below print to the screen? Write your answer on a piece of paper or in a text editor and then run each block of code to see if you were correct.


# '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

# Answer: "FALSE" ('4' is not equal to 4)
# Result: "FALSE"



# x = 2
# if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
#   puts "Did you get it right?"
# else
#   puts "Did you?"
# end

# Answer: "Did you get it right?" (3 == 3)
# Result: "Did you get it right?"



# y = 9
# x = 10
# if (x + 1) <= (y)
#   puts "Alright."
# elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
#   puts "Alright now!"
# elsif (y + 1) == x
#   puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
# else
#   puts "Alrighty!"
# end

# Answer: "Alright now!" (10 + 1 >= 9)
# Result: "Alright now!"
